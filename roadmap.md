# 🛣️ Bioart Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the strategic evolution of Bioart from a research prototype into a robust, extensible platform for biological computation and DNA-based programming.

---

## ✅ Completed Milestones

- Core VM with 100+ biological instructions
- Reversible DNA↔binary encoding (4 nt/byte optimal)
- Multi-layer error correction (Hamming, redundancy, quantum-ready)
- Synthesis abstraction and cost modeling
- Full byte coverage and deterministic round-trip testing
- Advanced instruction sets (ML, graph, matrix, signal)
- Performance benchmark: ~78MB/s throughput

---

## 🔜 Upcoming Phases

### 🔧 Phase 1: Infrastructure & Packaging

**Goals**:
- Formalize dependencies (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`)
- Add CI/CD pipeline with linting, coverage, and benchmarks
- Package for PyPI 

### 🧠 Phase 2: VM Modularization & Extensibility
 
**Goals**:
- Refactor VM into plugin-based architecture
- Add support for user-defined instructions
- Harden spec with conformance fixtures

### 🌐 Phase 3: API & Remote Execution

**Goals**:
- Build REST and gRPC API layer
- Enable remote execution of `.dna` programs
- Add metadata headers to `.dna` format

### 🎓 Phase 4: Playground & Documentation
 
**Goals**:
- Create web-based DNA↔binary converter and VM stepper
- Convert `docs/` into static site (e.g., MkDocs)
- Publish tutorials and educational modules

### 🧬 Phase 5: Advanced Optimization & Synthesis
  
**Goals**:
- Integrate ML-based sequence scoring
- Add quantum ECC (e.g., Steane code)
- Explore FPGA acceleration mapping

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Maintain 100% byte coverage
- Add fuzz testing and mutation resilience checks
- Simulate biological degradation (UV, oxidative, thermal)
- Validate round-trip integrity under stress conditions
