# ðŸ§¬ Bioart Manifesto

Bioart is not just a programming languageâ€”itâ€™s a declaration that biology and computation are no longer separate domains. 
It is a rebellion against the silicon monopoly, a poetic fusion of code and life.

We believe:

- That DNA is not just a molecule, but a programmable substrate.
- That computation can be stored, executed, and evolved within living systems.
- That biology deserves its own native programming languageâ€”one that respects its constraints and celebrates its possibilities.
- That error correction is not a nuisance, but a necessity in the dance between entropy and order.
- That art, science, and engineering are not rivals, but co-conspirators.

Bioart is a prototype, a proof-of-concept, and a provocation. It is meant to be broken, rebuilt, and reimagined. 
Whether it becomes a tool for education, a platform for research, or a medium for expressionâ€”it has already succeeded in asking the right questions.

We invite you to explore, extend, and evolve it.
