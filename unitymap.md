# Bioart Unity Map — From PoC to First Releases and Beyond

A single, actionable plan that unifies the Roadmap, Highway Map (critical path), and foundational docs into one coherent execution guide. It translates vision into phases, milestones, tasks, and Go/No‑Go criteria so the team knows exactly what to do next and how success is measured.

Sources harmonized:
- Highway Map (critical path): M0–M6, PR‑01..PR‑09, gates, SLO/SLA
- Roadmap: Phase 0–5 strategy and outcomes
- Core documentation: current capabilities, goals, and examples


## 0) North Star

- Purpose: Demonstrate DNA sequences as a complete, lossless, reversible digital/programming substrate, with a stable VM, deterministic DNA↔binary transforms, ECC layers, and a safe path to real-world integrations.
- Current status (Phase 0): Production-ready research prototype; VM + encoding validated, 100% round-trip accuracy, up to 78M bytes/sec decode throughput.
- First target release (R1): Stable core (VM + I/O), CLI, baseline telemetry, a “sandbox” adapter for safe integrations, packaging, and docs.

Key constraints (minimum SLO/SLA for R1):
- Success rate ≥ 99% for the critical path
- MTTR ≤ 30 minutes (with runbooks)
- Cost per 100 jobs ≤ budget threshold (TBD; instrument and enforce)
- Fresh install < 15 minutes; E2E smoke green


## 1) Phase Overview (Strategy → Delivery)

- Phase 0: Foundation & Stabilization — COMPLETE (v1.0)
- Phase 1: Developer Experience & Toolchain (Q1–Q2 2025)
- Phase 2: Instruction Set Expansion (Q3–Q4 2025)
- Phase 3: Biological Integration Foundations (Q1–Q2 2026)
- Phase 4: Performance & Ecosystem Scaling (Q3–Q4 2026)
- Phase 5: Wet‑Lab Integration & Real‑World Applications (2027+)

Cross-cutting tracks that apply across phases:
- Optimization: faster, cheaper, more stable and reliable
- Integration: safe ports/adapters; progressive rollout from sandbox to vendors
- Distribution: packaging, CLI, docs, SBOM, release pipeline

---

Direction of travel is clear:
1) Harden, measure, and optimize (M0–M2),
2) Integrate safely via sandbox and contracts (M3),
3) Make it reliable under stress (M4),
4) Ship as a trustworthy package (M5),
5) Stabilize and learn (M6),
then scale features and biological integrations through Phases 2–5.
