DNA Programming Language - Option 1 Implementation
=================================================

Overview
--------
This project implements a DNA-based programming language using 2-bit encoding 
for maximum efficiency and direct binary compatibility with existing computer 
systems. It demonstrates how biological DNA sequences can store and execute 
any type of digital data.

Key Features
------------
✓ 2-bit encoding: A=00, U=01, C=10, G=11
✓ Maximum efficiency: 4 nucleotides per byte
✓ Direct binary compatibility
✓ Universal data storage (ANY file type)
✓ Perfect reversibility (no data loss)
✓ Fast processing (no translation overhead)
✓ Memory efficient (smallest representation)
✓ System integration (works with all tools)

Core Encoding System
-------------------
DNA Nucleotide Mapping:
  A (Adenine)  = 00
  U (Uracil)   = 01  
  C (Cytosine) = 10
  G (Guanine)  = 11

Storage Format:
  4 nucleotides = 8 bits = 1 byte
  Example: AUCG = 00011011 = 27 (decimal)

This allows ALL 256 possible byte values to be represented as valid DNA 
sequences, enabling storage of any computer file as biological code.

DNA Instruction Set
------------------
Programming instructions use 4-nucleotide sequences:

AAAA (0)  - NOP    (No Operation)
AAAU (1)  - LOAD   (Load Value)
AAAC (2)  - STORE  (Store Value)  
AAAG (3)  - ADD    (Add)
AAUA (4)  - SUB    (Subtract)
AAUU (5)  - MUL    (Multiply)
AAUC (6)  - DIV    (Divide)
AAUG (7)  - PRINT  (Print Output)
AACA (8)  - INPUT  (Input)
AACU (9)  - JMP    (Jump)
AACC (10) - JEQ    (Jump if Equal)
AACG (11) - JNE    (Jump if Not Equal)
AAGA (12) - HALT   (Halt Program)

Example Programs
---------------
Hello World DNA Program:
  AAAU UACA AAUG AAGA
  (Load 72='H', Print, Halt)

Mathematical Calculation:
  AAAU AACA AAAG AAAC AAUG AAGA  
  (Load 42, Add 8, Print result=50, Halt)

Usage Instructions
-----------------
1. Run the demonstration:
   python dna_demo.py

2. Use the full interpreter:
   python dna_lang.py

3. Create your own DNA programs using the instruction set above

Technical Specifications
-----------------------
- Virtual Machine: 256 bytes memory, 4 registers (A,B,C,D)
- Program Counter: Tracks execution position
- Binary Format: Standard bytecode compatible with all systems
- File I/O: Save/load programs as .dna binary files
- Compiler: DNA source code → binary bytecode
- Decompiler: Binary bytecode → DNA source code
- Disassembler: Human-readable instruction listing

Universal Data Storage Examples
------------------------------
Text Storage:
  "Hi!" → UACAUCCUACAU → restored as "Hi!"

Binary Storage:
  [72,101,108,108,111] → UACAUCUUUCGAUCGAUCGG → "Hello"

Any File Type:
  Images, videos, documents, executables - all can be stored as DNA

Advantages Over Traditional Systems
----------------------------------
1. Biological Compatibility: Real DNA sequences can store digital data
2. Maximum Density: Most efficient possible encoding (4 nucleotides/byte)
3. Error Tolerance: Can implement biological error correction
4. Long-term Storage: DNA stable for thousands of years
5. Massive Parallelism: Biological processes can execute simultaneously
6. Self-Replication: DNA can copy itself with cellular machinery
