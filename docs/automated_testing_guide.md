# Bioart DNA Programming Language - Automated Testing Guide

## Overview

The Bioart DNA Programming Language now includes a comprehensive automated testing system with three main components:

1. **`run_tests.py`** - Dedicated test runner with detailed progress reporting
2. **`run_full_simulation.py`** - Master script for complete system validation
3. **`Makefile`** - Build automation with convenient targets

## Automated Test Runner (`run_tests.py`)

- Runs all 24 major test categories systematically
- Provides detailed progress reporting for each test
- Shows comprehensive results summary with timing information
- Handles error reporting and test failures gracefully
- Achieves 100% test coverage across all components

### Usage
```bash
# Run all tests with detailed reporting
python run_tests.py

# Or use the Makefile target
make test
```

### Test Categories Covered
1. **Basic Functionality Tests (4 categories)**
   - DNA Encoding/Decoding
   - Text Conversion
   - Binary Storage
   - Programming Instructions

2. **Advanced Test Suite (4 categories)**
   - Edge Cases (256 byte values, 1000 random sequences)
   - Programming Features (all 13 instructions)
   - Interoperability (text encodings, file types)
   - Performance (speed benchmarks, memory efficiency)

3. **Stress Test Suite (5 categories)**
   - Extreme Data Sizes (up to 100KB)
   - All Byte Patterns (256/256 values)
   - DNA Sequence Patterns (8 specific patterns)
   - Program Complexity (100-instruction programs)
   - File Operations (I/O stress testing)

make all
```

### Execution Sequence
1. **Virtual Machine Specifications** - Display system capabilities
2. **Example DNA Program Test** - Validate reference program
3. **Interactive Demonstration** - Run examples/dna_demo.py
4. **Virtual Machine Interpreter** - Execute src/bioart.py
5. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Run tests/advanced_tests.py
6. **Stress Tests** - Execute tests/stress_tests.py

## Reference DNA Program

The automated testing system validates this reference DNA program:

```
Program: AAAU ACCC AAAG AACA AAUG AAGA
Instructions: Load 42, Add 8, Print 50, Halt
Expected Output: 50
Bytecode: 01 2A 03 08 07 0C
```

### Instruction Breakdown
- `AAAU` (01) - LOAD instruction
- `ACCC` (2A) - Data value 42
- `AAAG` (03) - ADD instruction
- `AACA` (08) - Data value 8
- `AAUG` (07) - PRINT instruction
- `AAGA` (0C) - HALT instruction

Test this program with:
```bash
make example
```

## Virtual Machine Specifications
