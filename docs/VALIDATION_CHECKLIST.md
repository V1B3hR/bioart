# Bioart Validation Checklist

This checklist validates the key claims and features of the Bioart project. For each item, record evidence and artifacts so results are reproducible.

How to use
- Create an artifacts directory to collect logs/results:
  - mkdir -p artifacts/{env,tests,coverage,benchmarks,demos,workflows,docs}
- Run commands below and save outputs to artifacts/ subfolders.
- Check off each box when evidence is captured and pass criteria are met.

## 0) Environment and Reproducibility

- [ ] Record system info (OS, CPU, RAM, Python)
  - Command:
    - python -V | tee artifacts/env/python_version.txt
    - python -c "import platform,sys;print(platform.platform());print(sys.version)" | tee artifacts/env/system.txt
  - Include CPU model and core count if possible.

- [ ] Record repo state
  - Command:
    - git rev-parse HEAD | tee artifacts/env/commit.txt
    - git status --porcelain | tee artifacts/env/status.txt

- [ ] Freeze Python dependencies (if any used locally)
  - Command: python -m pip freeze | tee artifacts/env/pip_freeze.txt

- [ ] Randomness control (if applicable)
  - Document seeds used in ML/optimization tests and store in artifacts/env/seeds.txt.

Pass criteria: All environment and state artifacts saved for reproducibility.


## 1) Encoding Correctness and Reversibility

Claim: 2-bit mapping (A=00, U=01, C=10, G=11) is perfectly reversible for arbitrary data.

- [ ] Run demos/tests covering encoding/decoding
  - Command:
    - python examples/dna_demo.py | tee artifacts/demos/dna_demo.log
    - python run_tests.py | tee artifacts/tests/run_tests.log  (or: pytest -q | tee artifacts/tests/pytest.log)
- [ ] File round-trip proof: binary → DNA → binary
  - Prepare a sample file (e.g., small PNG or ZIP) and perform encode/decode using the project’s API or a provided example script.
  - Verify SHA-256 equality.
  - Commands (example workflow; adjust to your encode/decode CLI/API):
    - sha256sum sample.bin | tee artifacts/tests/sha_before.txt
    - python -c "import sys"  # Replace with actual encode call
    - python -c "import sys"  # Replace with actual decode call
    - sha256sum sample_restored.bin | tee artifacts/tests/sha_after.txt
- [ ] Property or fuzz testing across byte spectrum
  - Run stress tests:
    - python tests/stress_tests.py | tee artifacts/tests/stress_tests.log

Evidence:
- Logs: dna_demo.log, run_tests.log or pytest.log, stress_tests.log
- Checksums: sha_before.txt vs sha_after.txt

Pass criteria:
- All round-trip conversions produce exact SHA-256 matches.
- No failures in encoding/decoding tests.


## 2) Virtual Machine and Instruction Set Conformance

Claim: 106+ instructions implemented; VM behaves per spec.

- [ ] Execute advanced and feature tests
  - python tests/advanced_tests.py | tee artifacts/tests/advanced_tests.log
  - python tests/test_enhanced_features.py | tee artifacts/tests/test_enhanced_features.log
- [ ] Code coverage for VM and instruction handlers
  - If using pytest:
    - pip install coverage
    - coverage run -m pytest
    - coverage html -d artifacts/coverage/html
    - coverage xml -o artifacts/coverage/coverage.xml
  - If not using pytest, run coverage over test entry points:
    - coverage run run_tests.py
    - coverage html -d artifacts/coverage/html
- [ ] Instruction set cross-check (docs vs implementation)
  - Compare docs/INSTRUCTION_SET.md against handler table/dispatch in code (e.g., src/bioart.py, src/bioart_language.py, src/vm/*).
  - Produce a checklist mapping each opcode in docs to an executed test case and paste into artifacts/tests/instruction_coverage.md.

Evidence:
- Logs: advanced_tests.log, test_enhanced_features.log
- Coverage reports in artifacts/coverage/
- instruction_coverage.md mapping

Pass criteria:
- All instruction categories exercised; no unimplemented opcodes masquerading as implemented.
- Coverage report shows each opcode executed at least once (or rationale provided).


## 3) Performance Benchmarks

Claim: Processing up to 78 MB/s.

- [ ] Define benchmark datasets and environment (CPU freq, cores).
- [ ] Run stress/benchmark suite with timing
  - Examples:
    - /usr/bin/time -v python tests/stress_tests.py 2>&1 | tee artifacts/benchmarks/stress_time.log
    - /usr/bin/time -v python run_full_simulation.py 2>&1 | tee artifacts/benchmarks/full_sim_time.log
- [ ] Compute throughput (MB/s) from processed bytes and wall time.
  - Record methodology in artifacts/benchmarks/methodology.md
  - Capture raw sizes, repetitions, mean/median, stddev.

Pass criteria:
- Reported throughput and methodology reproduced; any deviation from 78 MB/s is explained (hardware, dataset).


## 4) Biological Error Correction and Environmental Modeling

Claim: Multi-layer ECC with environmental modeling improves accuracy.

- [ ] Execute biological features tests
  - python tests/test_advanced_biological_features.py | tee artifacts/tests/test_advanced_bio.log
  - python tests/test_enhanced_features.py | tee artifacts/tests/test_enhanced_features.log

    - python - <<'PY' | tee artifacts/demos/biological_ecc_demo.log
from src.biological.error_correction import BiologicalErrorCorrection
ec = BiologicalErrorCorrection()
ec.set_environmental_conditions({'uv_exposure': 'high'})
protected = ec.encode_with_error_correction('AUCGAUC', redundancy_level=3)
print('Protected:', protected)
PY

Evidence:
- Logs showing error injection and correction rates (before/after), or surrogate metrics.
- Document parameters used and measured improvements in artifacts/tests/bio_ecc_results.md.

Pass criteria:

- [ ] Run quantum ECC example (from README)
  - python - <<'PY' | tee artifacts/demos/quantum_ecc_demo.log
from src.biological.quantum_error_correction import QuantumErrorCorrector, QuantumCodeType
corrector = QuantumErrorCorrector()
encoded = corrector.encode_with_quantum_ecc('AUCGAUC', QuantumCodeType.STEANE_CODE)
result = corrector.decode_with_quantum_ecc(encoded, QuantumCodeType.STEANE_CODE)
print('Original: AUCGAUC')
print('Protected:', encoded)
print('Quantum overhead:', result.quantum_overhead)
PY
- [ ] Validate against known properties/test vectors (if available) and document.

Pass criteria:
- Round-trip decode recovers original under defined error bounds; overhead metrics reported and consistent.


## 6) Machine Learning Sequence Optimization

    job_id='TEST_001', sequence='AUCGAUC', instrument_id='SYNTH_001',
    operator='test', started_at=datetime.now(),
    estimated_completion=datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=1),
    current_phase=SynthesisPhase.PREPARATION, current_cycle=0, total_cycles=7,
    synthesis_method='test'

registered = monitor.register_synthesis_job(job)
print('Job registered:', registered)
print('Dashboard:', monitor.get_dashboard_data())
PY
